# Yield Farming

### Overview

Farm \#5 will be with a Uniswap pool of STABLEx and USDC. In order to maintain a better price we will start by incentivising Liquidity Providers to provide on the pool.

In order to participate:

1. You **must mint STABLEx tokens** via the app \([https://app.arcx.money/mint](https://app.arcx.money/mint)\)
2. Deposit STABLEx and USDC into the Uniswap pool: [https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xcd91538b91b4ba7797d39a2f66e63810b50a33d0](https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xcd91538b91b4ba7797d39a2f66e63810b50a33d0). **Those who simply buy tokens will not receive ARCx rewards**
3. Visit [https://app.arcx.money/farms](https://app.arcx.money/farms) and deposit your Uniswap LP tokens received in the previous step

Yield farming will occur over a period of **4 weeks** and **500 ARCx tokens** will be distributed. Please note that ARCx is not yet tradable.

All tokens issued will be subject to a 2 month lockup \(after the initial 4 week farming period\)

**IMPORTANT:** If you close your STABLEx debt position before the lockup period **all of your rewards will be slashed**.
