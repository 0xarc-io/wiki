# üõÇ Passport

### Passports

The analogy of a Passport was a very deliberate choice. Similar to passports issued by countries, the ARCx Passport allows you to discover the best the world of Web 3 has to offer. As more scores and benefits are added, and the better your reputation is, the greater the value of holding a Passport will be.

### How to claim

To claim a Passport, simply visit [arcx.money](http://arcx.money), connect your wallet, and then click ‚Äúclaim passport‚Äù. Your wallet will then request a signature to approve the claim. Once this is done, your Passport has been minted, and your scores will be available to view.

### Skins

Skins are NFTs that customise the look and feel of your Passport. You can use these skins to express what you value by showing support for a favourite project or to express a specific visual aesthetic that resonates with what you‚Äôre about.

Once you obtain a Skin, it will be available to equip onto your Passport within [arcx.money](http://arcx.money). Skins can be purchased from the collection on OpenSea[https://opensea.io/collection/arcx-defi-passport-skins](https://opensea.io/collection/arcx-defi-passport-skins).

### OG Passport Skin

The release of ‚Äú[passport hyper-accessibility](https://twitter.com/arcxmoney/status/1473110523575103491)‚Äù rendered passports free to claim and removed the need to pay gas through minting an actual NFT. Alongside this, we developed an ‚ÄúOG Passport Skin‚Äù to recognise our early supporters who locked up ARCx tokens and paid gas to mint a Passport.
