# Is ARCx Credit available yet?

As part of our risk and product development objectives, we have chosen to share ARCx Credit with a limited number of trusted users first before a broader public release. The purpose of our Closed Beta program is to test and refine the application in a low risk environment ahead of our audit with Trail of Bits in October 2022.

We have created a waitlist for those interested in using the app first. To join, simply visit [https://arcx.money](https://arcx.money) and fill in your information.

Over the coming weeks we will gradually whitelist new addresses to use the app. If you are particularly interested in getting started, please reach out to our team via [Discord](http://discord.gg/arcx) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/arcxmoney).
