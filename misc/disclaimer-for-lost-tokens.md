# Disclaimer for lost tokens

Due to how the ARCx Governance Token contract \(0x1321f1f1aa541a56c31682c57b80ecfccd9bb288\) is configured, **all tokens sent to this address are lost and completely irretrievable.**

It is each individualâ€™s responsibility to check they are sending tokens to the correct address before confirming the transaction. 

**We do not offer reimbursements for lost tokens under any circumstances.**
