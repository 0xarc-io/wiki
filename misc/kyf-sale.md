#### Calculations

The following outlines how we did the calculations for each user. For each of the farms we allocated a number of tokens that could be purchased:

* Farm 1: 110
* Farm 2: 60
* Farm 3: 40
* Farm 4: 190

Then we took the number of participants per farm which gives us a distribution per wallet \(e.g. if 10 people participated in Farm 1 then it would be 110 / 10 = 11 ArcX per wallet\)

Finally we simply add up the allocations on a per wallet basis. This means that those who participated in all 4 farms would have more rewards than those who participated in only a single farm.

### **Important Notes**

* Do **NOT** use a wallet that is not approved. Funds will **not be refunded**
* Do **NOT** send more than you are allocated. Funds will **not be refunded**
* If you send less than your allocation, you will be allocated ARCx pro rata
