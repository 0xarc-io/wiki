### Calculation

For simplicity we will assume that 1 USDC = 1 STABLEx = 1 USD

To calculate the number of ARCx tokens you are eligible for you first take the total amount of liquidity on a per second basis, where the total amount of liquidity is the sum of all of your USDC and STABLEx.

You then take this number and calculate it as a percentage across all wallets to get your weight \(i.e. your liquidity / total liquidity\)

Finally, you multiply this percentage by the total amount of ARCx available to purchase

**Example:**

1. You deposit 10 USDC and 10 STABLEx for 10 seconds. In this instance you will have 10 \* \(10 + 10\) = 200
2. You then remove 5 USDC and 5 STABLEx for another 10 seconds. For this time period you have 10 \* \(5+5\) = 100
3. You finally remove all liquidity and wait until the pool to end. In this example you simply take the sum of the two so 200 + 100 = 300
4. Let's say there was another 3000 in liquidity over time. Your weight is then 300 / 3000 = 0.1
5. Say there are 1200 ARCx tokens, you will be eligible for 1200 \* 0.1 = 120
