# Supplying

ARCx Credit have supplied $100K from the treasury into our lending pools for the Closed Beta. During this period, we have limited the functionality for supplying as we test and refine the system. However, we will shortly allow anyone to lend assets to Borrowers on the platform.&#x20;

Similar to our vault design, the supply pools have been divided into three distinct options (A, B or C), with each corresponding to the equivalent borrow vault of the same name. In combination with the vault-specific Score Thresholds, Lenders will be able to provide liquidity to Borrowers with specific DeFi Credit Scores (e.g. only Borrowers with DeFi Credit Scores above 500). In return for providing liquidity, Lenders receive a portion of the fees generated by Borrowers. The profit earned from a Borrower is equal to the net revenue earned from that Borrower minus the losses they incur from unprofitable liquidations.
