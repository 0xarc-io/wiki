# Borrowing

ARCx Credit is a decentralized liquidity market that offers the safest and most capital efficient borrowing experience through the use of the DeFi Credit Score. Our system uses the DeFi Credit Score to offer personalized loan-to-value (LTV) ratios to every wallet address in the market (where the higher the Score, the greater the maximum LTV). We have implemented a three-tiered vault design, with each collateral asset having three distinct vault options distinguished by the range of max LTVs offered, the minimum Score required to access the vault, and the maximum credit limit a borrower can access (regardless of their deposited collateral). Through this system, Borrowers can progressively unlock greater capital efficiency as they build their Credit Score, while ARCx can maintain net profitability across our loan book as it extends more credit to its Borrowers.
